# BST-SecondLargestElement
Write a method to find the 2nd largest element in a binary search tree


Complexity:
We're doing one walk down our BST, which means O(h)O(h) time, where hh is the height of the tree (again, that's O(\lg{n})O(lgn) if the tree is balanced, O(n)O(n) otherwise). O(1)O(1) space.
